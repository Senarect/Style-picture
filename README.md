# Style-picture
This sigle file is just a script which allow you to combine the picture with different style.
You just need to insert the original image and style image (like I show below) in the script and get the result.

Loading the original and the style image:

original_image=image_loader('./HereOriginalImageName.jpg')

style_image=image_loader('./HereOriginalStyleName.jpg')
